# happy-birthday

My friend Hillary's birthday is coming up, and I'd like to sing her a
copyrighted song. Let's use our computer skills to make her smile!

## Usage

I don't know yet.

## License

There is no license, since "Happy Birthday" is a legal buggabear. I'm
stealing the song from the children!
